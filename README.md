## <a name="des">Description</a>
<p> For SMU Coding Bootcamp's Final Project </p><br>
<p> Elevator pitch: I work in a small nonprofit space. There are 4 of us wearing a million different hats. We are also very loud and disorganized. I wanted to build an app that allowed us to work independently while allowing us to inform each other of needs and updates to projects.

Concept: A one stop shop for a small office's communication that's supported by a database, so nothing is lost but also keeps work to your work life.

Process: I had to switch up my original project idea 2 to 3 times due to severe difficulties with graphql/Apollo. The past 2 weeks are littered with abandoned repos.

Backend packages include: Apollo Server, bcrypt, GraphQl, JSONWebToken, & Mongoose.
Frontend packages include: Apollo Client, Cloudinary (image hosting to retain a clean db), axios (quick get/post to outside api interactions), React Big Calendar, date-fns (for ease of date items).

Demo: Please feel free to play in the application. There's one major bug due to gql difficulties and it does not look as nice as I would like.

Directions for future development: UI! Make it look nice and add capabilities that allow for delete mutations and editing for items. Everything could look much nicer, I'm very disappointed in this project and my inabilities to grasp gql/apollo. My original idea for this particular iteration was a messenger, calendar, task, and chat based site for small nonprofit businesses. This way the tasks that are exclusively internal are all monitored and kept up with.
